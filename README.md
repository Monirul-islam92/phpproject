1) A user once logged to the site will be given the choice to subscribe to movie selections NOT previously subscribed to.

2) A link will also be provided that will take the user to a page that shows only their current movie subscriptions (a "My Subscriptions Page")

3) On the "My Subscriptions Page" the user is given the ability to click a currently subscribed movie and be taken to another page (Movie Details Page) that will show some details about the movie provided directly from themoviedatabase.org through information retrieved via its API.  The information should not be stored by the system (the page must use the API to dynamically retrieve the movie's details).

Note: Only movie ID numbers should be stored in the database.

4) The user should be able to "unsubscribe" from the movie on its "Movie Details Page".

5) The "Movie Details Page" page will also include (in addition to the details of the movie described above) an embedded youtube video of the movie trailer and that embedded video's link must be retrieved dynamically using the themoviedatabase API.
